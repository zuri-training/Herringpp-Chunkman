              I was doing some data mining and needed to split a large JSON file
              into smaller chunks so that I could upload them to a data storage
              service. I tried using a few different programs, but couldn't get
              any of them to work. Then I was searching for a solution to the
              problem and found ChunkIt.

              ChunkIt makes it easy to split CSV and JSON files into smaller
              chunks with just one click. It's not always fun to work with a
              large file and this is a lifesaver. You don't need any skills to
              use it, either!

              I've been using ChunkIt for years and it's been great. It's really
              useful for the files I have that are so large that they are hard
              to work with. I don't have any complaints, it just works and has
              never crashed on me or anything like that.

              Usually, when I have to work with large files, I have to export
              them as JSON and work on them in a database. It's just not the
              most efficient way of working. ChunkIt was different however.
