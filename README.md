## Introduction
A platform that accepts CSV or JSON large files, and breaks them into smaller bits.
In order to guarantee the success of this project, the contributors would produce vital pieces of information.

## Project Background
The world of the internet is here and it's here to stay. File compression is an essential part of contemporary skills for anyone working in the line of accounting, auditing, business administration etc. As it can benefit or harm one's business or organization. However, based on the majority of websites' usability, people still lack these skills. The next question we asked ourselves was how can we build a platform that will allow use's creativity to engage in secure online CSV and JSON files compression without running the danger of being unable to download or save files for a later purpose etc.Then we created this garbage file compressor to provide users the ability to look into their online activity.

## What are we building?
We are developing a web app with a library of various file compressors that authenticated users can utilize to successfully download their files. in addition, the user can engage with the platform by saving files for later download.
